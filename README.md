No Central Authority:

Votes are recorded and processed by the blockchain—no entity can control or manipulate the process.
Public Verification:

Anyone can access the vote data using the contract, ensuring full transparency.
Immutable Records:

Once votes or candidates are registered, they cannot be deleted or altered—ensuring vote integrity.
Self-Executing Rules:

The contract’s logic is executed automatically without relying on human intervention.
